From transmission line theory, it is known that the voltage and current waves present on a transmission line is composed of an incident and a reflected wave. The voltage and current at any distance, $z$, from the load are \cite{pozar2011microwave}
\begin{align}%%
    V(z) &= V^+e^{-j\beta z} + V^-e^{j\beta z}\\
    I(z) &= \frac{V^+}{Z_0} e^{-j\beta z} - \frac{V^-}{Z_0} e^{j\beta z}
\end{align}
where
\begin{where}
\item[$V(z)$] Voltage at distance $z$ [\si{V}].
\item[$I(z)$] Current at distance $z$ [\si{A}].
\item[$V^+$] Amplitude of the incident wave [\si{V}].
\item[$V^-$] Amplitude of the reflected wave [\si{V}].
\item[$Z_0$] Characteristic impedance of the transmission line [\si{\ohm}].
\item[$z$] Distance from load to the considered point [\si{m}].
\item[$\beta$] The wave number $=2\pi/\lambda$ [\si{rad\per m}].
\end{where}
The load impedance is the voltage-to-current ratio where $z=0$,
\begin{equation}%%
    Z_L = \frac{V(0)}{I(0)} = \frac{V^+ + V^-}{V^+ - V^-}Z_0
\end{equation}
Solving this for $V^-$ yields
\begin{equation}
    V^- = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0} V^+
\end{equation}
The ratio between the reflected and incident wave is known as the \emph{reflection coefficient}, denoted $\Gamma$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:reflect}
    \Gamma = \frac{V^-}{V^+} = \frac{Z_L-Z_0}{Z_L+Z_0}
\end{equation}
Generally, the reflection coefficient along a transmission line can be written as \cite{ebert1998transmission}
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma(z) = \Gamma e^{j2\beta z}
\end{equation}
Note that $\Gamma$ without parameters indicates $\Gamma(0)$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics{img/analysis/generator_load}
    \caption{Equivalent circuit of a generator with given output impedance, $Z_G$, delivering power to a load of a given impedance, $Z_L$.}
    \label{fig:generator_load}
\end{figure}

To maximize the power transferred from a generator to a load, it is desired to have a reflection coefficient that is zero so that only forward waves are present on the transmission line. Figure~\ref{fig:generator_load} shows an equivalent circuit for this situation. The average power delivered to the load is found as \cite{pozar2011microwave}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:power1}
    P = \frac{1}{2} \real{V_LI^*} = \frac{1}{2} \real{\frac{|V_L|^2}{Z_L}}
    = \frac{1}{2} |V_L|^2 \real{\frac{1}{Z_L}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{where}
\item[$P$] Average power delivered to the load.
\item[$V_L$] Voltage drop across the load.
\item[$Z_L$] $R_L+jX_L$ is the load impedance.
\item[$I$] Current through the load.
\end{where}
Using basic circuit theory, Equation~\ref{eq:power1} can be expressed in terms of $V_G$ and $Z_G$, making it possible to derive the optimal $Z_G = R_G+jX_G$ for a fixed, complex load. Continuing from Equation~\ref{eq:power1},
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        P &= \frac{1}{2} \left| V_G \frac{Z_L}{Z_L+Z_G} \right|^2 \real{\frac{1}{Z_L}} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} |V_G|^2 \frac{|Z_L|^2}{|Z_L+Z_G|^2} \real{\frac{1}{Z_L}}\\
        &= \frac{|V_G|^2}{2} \frac{R_L^2+X_L^2}{(R_L+R_G)^2+(X_L+X_G)^2} \frac{R_L}{R_L^2 + X_L^2}\\
        &= \frac{|V_G|^2}{2} \frac{R_L}{(R_L+R_G)^2 + (X_L+X_G)^2}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The values of $R_G$ and $X_G$ that maximize the power delivered to the load, is found by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Taking the partial derivative of $P$ with respect to $R_L$.
\item Taking the partial derivative of $P$ with respect to $X_L$.
\item Setting both of the above solutions equal to zero and solving for $R_G$ and $X_G$ (two equations with two unknowns).
    \begin{align}
        \dpd{P}{R_L} &= 0 \\
        \dpd{P}{X_L} &= 0
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
Doing so, yields the following solution,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        R_{G,\text{max}} &= R_L \\
        X_{G,\text{max}} &= -X_L
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
or $Z_{G,\text{max}} = Z^*_L$; the maximum power is transferred to the load when the generator impedance is the complex conjugate of the load impedance. In this situation, the generator is said to be \emph{matched} to the load. Generally, the generator and the load would be connected through a transmission line with the characteristic impedance $Z_0$, so the maximum power transfer from generator to load will occur when both generator and load are matched to $Z_0$. 

% Mismatch loss, S11. |S11| = -6 dB  -->  SWR = 3
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{img/analysis/s_parameter_twoport}
    \caption{$S$-parameters of a two-port system.}
    \label{fig:twoport}
\end{figure}

The reflection coefficient, $\Gamma$, can more generally be described as an \emph{$S$-parameter}. The $S$-parameters describe the ratio between the reflected and incident wave at a given port in a system. Consider a two-port as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:twoport}. Its four $S$-parameters are defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &S_{11} = \frac{V_1^-}{V_1^+} \Bigg|_{V_2^+=0} = \Gamma_1
        &&S_{12} = \frac{V_1^-}{V_2^+} \Bigg|_{V_1^+=0} \\
        &S_{21} = \frac{V_2^-}{V_1^+} \Bigg|_{V_2^+=0}
        &&S_{22} = \frac{V_2^-}{V_2^+} \Bigg|_{V_1^+=0} = \Gamma_2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
It is seen that $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ indicate the reflection due to the incident wave on the same port, when no contribution is made from the opposite port, i.e.\ these are the reflection coefficients of port 1 and 2, respectively. The parameter $S_{21}$ indicates how much of the incident wave on port 1 is coming out of port 2 when no wave is incident on port 2, i.e.\ this indicates the \emph{transmission coefficient} from port 1 to port 2. Likewise, $S_{12}$ is the transmission coefficient from port 2 to port 1.

The $S$-parameters are easily measured using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The advantage of measuring $S$-parameters over, e.g., $Y$-parameters is that all ports are matched during the measurement instead of some being shorted, making odd behavior (like oscillations) less likely \cite{Bowick2007}.

        \end{smithchart}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Smithchart. The circle illustrates the limit for which all points within the circle have a reflection coefficient below $\Gamma=0.5$ (or \SI{-6}{dB}). Two points -- $0.5+j0.2$ and $0.5+j0.5$ -- are shown.}
    \label{fig:smithchart}
\end{figure}
An important tool when doing matching, and designing antennas, to a certain $Z_0$ is the smith chart. The smith chart is used for plotting complex, normalized impedances and makes it easy to visually analyze the performance of a matched circuit. A smith chart is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:smithchart}.

The smith chart maps the entire right complex half-plane into a circle, having $0+j0$ all the way to the left and $\infty+j0$ all the way to the right. The $y$-axis (crossing $x=0$) makes up the circumference of the circle. An impedance is plotted by first finding the resistive (real) part of the impedance on the horizontal line and then following the circular grid-lines up or down for positive or negative reactances, respectively. 
The smith chart shown in Figure~\ref{fig:smithchart} is a normalized smith chart. When matching to $Z_0$, any impedance, $Z$, plotted in the smith chart, must be normalized by $Z_0$,
\begin{equation}
    Z_n = \frac{Z}{Z_0}
\end{equation}
This means that $Z_0$ will always appear at $1+j0$ -- in the center of the smith chart -- and the goal of the matching is to get the impedance of the antenna (or other circuitry) as close to the center as possible for the desired frequency range.

The impedance bandwidth of an antenna is often given as the bandwidth for which the reflection coefficient, $\Gamma$, is below 0.5 (or \SI{-6}{dB}; when denoting the reflection coefficient in (positive) decibels, it is commonly called \emph{return loss}, $\text{RL} = -20\log_{10}|\Gamma|$ \cite{pozar2011microwave}). It may therefore be advantageous to plot this requirement. In the smith chart, this is plotted as a circle around the center and any point within the circle, is within the bandwidth of the circuit. The \SI{-6}{dB} circle is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:smithchart}. This type of circle is also known as an VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) circle. The connection between the VSWR and the reflection coefficient is \cite{pozar2011microwave}
\begin{equation}
    \text{SWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}
\end{equation}
At $\Gamma = \SI{-6}{dB}$, the SWR is 3.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{L-network. The series/shunt configuration depends on the value of the load impedance.}
    \label{fig:l_network}
\end{figure}
In case the antenna is not designed to resonate exactly at the desired frequency or to the exact impedance bandwidth required, a tuning network can be placed immediately before the antenna. 

The simplest matching network is the L-network which is made from two components -- one in series an one in shunt -- as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:l_network}. The values of $X$ and $B$ correspond to the reactance of the chosen component at the frequency of interest. The values of $X$ and $B$ (and their corresponding component values) can be derived through circuit theory, as done by \cite{pozar2011microwave}. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:match_XB}.

There are two solutions: One for choosing $\pm=+$ and one for choosing $\pm=-$ \cite{pozar2011microwave}.}

\subsection{$Q$-Factor}
The $Q$-factor describes the ratio between the reactive and the resistive part of a component is \cite{pozar2011microwave}
\begin{equation}
    \label{fig:compq}
    Q = \frac{X}{R}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{where}
\item[$X$] Reactance of the component.
\item[$R$] Resistive part of the component.
\end{where}
Ideal capacitors and inductors are purely reactive and therefore, no power is lost in them (the average power $P = \real{VI*} = |V|^2 / \real{Z}$ only depends on the real part of $Z$ \cite{irwin2011engineering}). However, practical components also have a small resistive part called the equivalent series resistance (ESR) which causes power to be delivered to the component, increasing the power loss. From Equation~\ref{fig:compq}, it is therefore seen that a \emph{large} $Q$-factor is desired for capacitors and inductors. The $Q$-factor of an antenna should, however, not necessarily be large as it is desired to lose power due to radiation, but a low $Q$-factor is not necessarily a good thing either, as the power loss may be caused by resistive loss in the antenna and not radiation.

\subsection{Bode-Fano Criterion}
The Bode-Fano criterion is a relation between the reflection coefficient and the obtainable bandwidth. In fact, this criterion provides a theoretical limit to the magnitude of the reflection coefficient over a specific bandwidth using a passive lossless matching network \cite{pozar2011microwave}. The criterion is inherently dependent on the type of load impedance, but for general passive serial or parallel RC or RL loads, the criteria can be expressed as \cite{RahulSarpeshkarUltra}
\begin{align}
  \int_0^{\infty} \ln \Big( \frac{1}{|\Gamma (\omega)|} \Big) d\omega \leq \frac{\pi \omega_0}{Q_0}
\end{align}
where
\begin{where}
\item[$\Gamma$] Frequency dependent reflection coefficient.
\item[$Q_0$] $Q$-factor of the load.
\item[$\omega_0$] Center frequency.
\end{where}
For the ideal reflection coefficient response, the reflection coefficient is $|\Gamma|=1$ everywhere but in the required band $\Delta \omega$. Inside the band, the reflection coefficient is given by a maximum accepted value $|\Gamma|=\Gamma_{m}$. This ideal response is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:idealReflec}. For this case, the Bode-Fano criterion reduces to \cite{AntennaswithNonFosterMatchingNetworks}
\begin{align}
  \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} Q_0 = \frac{\pi}{\ln \big(\frac{1}{\Gamma_m} \big)}
\end{align}
This leads to the following conclusions \cite{pozar2011microwave}:
\begin{itemize}
\item For a fixed load ($Q_0$ is constant) the bandwidth can only be increased at the cost of a higher reflection coefficient in the passband $\Gamma_m$.
\item Perfect matching in the passband ($\Gamma_m = 0$), can only occur at discrete frequencies when $\Delta \omega = 0$.
\item High-$Q$ circuits are harder to match than low-$Q$ circuits.
\end{itemize}

% Tuners: Series capacitor, shunt capacitor, variable inductor?
\subsection{Tuners}
From the description above, it is seen that the resonance frequency of an antenna can be altered by changing the matching network. By replacing a fixed capacitor with a variable capacitor, it is possible to cover a broader total bandwidth by tuning the resonance frequency. As the achievable bandwidth is generally proportional to the size of the antenna (see Section~\ref{sec:basicantennaparams}), it will be possible to cover a large bandwidth using a physically smaller antenna by having a variable matching network. This is desirable for mobile phones where the physical size of the antenna is limited and multiple bands must be covered \cite{gu2014rf}.

\subsubsection{Variable Capacitors}
Three basic types of variable capacitors will now be described briefly. 

Barium strontium titanate (BST) varactors are voltage controlled components where the bias voltage determines the amount of capacitance provided by the component. The $Q$-factor is dependent on the tuning range, $\eta$. For a tuning range of $\eta = 2$--$4$ at around \SI{3}{GHz}, the $Q$-factor is around 30--65 \cite{gu2014rf}. 

A downside of the BST varactor is that it is quite nonlinear, having a typical third order intercept point ($\text{IIP}_3$) of around 32--\SI{40}{dBm} \cite{gu2014rf}. Also, an external power supply is necessary to bias the varactor.

Another type of variable capacitor is a SOI/SOS digitally tunable capacitor (SOI $=$ silicon on isolator switches, SOS $=$ silicon on sapphire switches). These consist of metal-isolator-metal (MIM) capacitors which are digitally switched using CMOS SOI or SOS switches as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sossoiswitch}. 

The $Q$-factor around \SI{2}{GHz} of SOS/SOI digitally tunable capacitors (DTC) is typically 40--50 at minimum capacitance and $\geq$ 15 at maximum capacitance \cite{gu2014rf}. This is generally worse than the BTS varactors. The linearity, however, is generally better than for the BTS varactors with an $\text{IIP}_3$ of around \SI{44}{dBm} \cite{gu2014rf}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{img/analysis/sossoi_dtc}
    \caption{Circuit showing the operation of a SOS/SOI digitally tunable capacitor. To the left, the minimum capacitance situation is shown, where only parasitic capacitance from the switches is present. To the right, the maximum capacitance situation is shown where the on-resistance of the switches degrades the $Q$-factor.}
    \label{fig:sossoiswitch}
\end{figure}

A big advantage of the SOI/SOS DTCs is that their control voltage is less than \SI{5}{V} and that they are quite low cost \cite{gu2014rf}.

The last type of capacitor described is a MEMS tunable capacitor, which is the type used for this project. The MEMS tunable capacitor cell is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:memscap}.

A MEMS tunable capacitor consists of several of the cells shown in Figure~\ref{fig:memscap}. By applying a voltage on one or more of the cells, the top plate is pulled toward the bottom electrode, increasing the overall capacitance. 

The $Q$-factor of a MEMS tunable capacitor is much higher than that of the BTS varactor and the SOI/SOS DTS -- typically higher than 200 at minimum capacitance and above 100 at maximum capacitance, at \SI{2}{GHz} \cite{gu2014rf}. The linearity is also better, having an achievable $\text{IIP}_3$ of greater than \SI{68}{dBm} at \SI{2.5}{GHz}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tuner Modeling}
% [Gu Sec 2.1 and 2.2], [Bowick RF]: S-parameters --> component values
% Insertion loss, S21 for networks, equivalent series resistance, component Q.
A tunable capacitor as described above would ideally have a purely imaginary impedance (infinite $Q$) and a reactance only made up of capacitance. As it happens, the ideal capacitor is impossible to come by in real life. Real capacitors have an equivalent series resistance (ESR) and parasitic capacitance and inductance determined by the physical layout of the component. To use a tunable capacitor in simulation, an equivalent circuit for the capacitor is therefore more accurate than using an ideal capacitor.

Two types of equivalent networks are common to represent a two-port network:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The $\pi$-network, with two shunt impedances and one series impedance in between. This is used for modeling a \emph{series tunable capacitor}.
\item The T-network, with two series impedances and one shunt impedance in between. This is used for modeling a \emph{shunt tunable capacitor}.
\end{enumerate}
The two networks are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sparam_to_circuit}. The values of the components in the networks can be determined by measuring the $S$-parameters of a tunable capacitor at two frequencies. The two frequencies are necessary to obtain both capacitive and inductive parasitics. For the result to be accurate, the $S$-parameter measurements must be made very accurate \cite{gu2014rf}. The conversion formulas from $S$-parameters to component values are likewise shown in Table~\ref{tab:sparam_to_circuit}.

    Based on the knowledge from this section, it is possible to accurately model a MEMS tunable capacitor from $S$-parameter measurements of it. It is also clear how a matching circuit can be designed, using the smith chart, to maximize the power delivered to the antenna.

    The next sections will describe some of the important terms and metrics used in a link budget. The next section describes basic propagation models, which are used to connect a maximum allowed path loss with a certain communication distance for different environments.
