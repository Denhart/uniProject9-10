\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}
The problem statement, which will be investigated in this report, is formulated as the following:
\begin{quote}
    \itshape
    How can a pair of MIMO antennas for LTE handsets be designed so that all bands from \SI{700}{MHz} to \SI{960}{MHz} and from \SI{1710}{MHz} to \SI{2650}{MHz} are covered with a total efficiency above \SI{50}{\%} using a tunable MEMS capacitor, and how does a small ground clearance -- the distance between the antenna element and the ground plane -- affect the performance?
\end{quote}
The further specifications for the design will be described next in the requirement specification.
