\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{fbands}---Frequency Bands/Tunable Range}
The frequency spectrum and the tunable range is tested by measuring the S11 and S22 parameters, using a VNA, for the top and side antenna respectively. The tunable range is done accordingly to requirement \sreqref{tunable} using a variable capacitor in the range \SI{0.3}{pF} to \SI{2.9}{pF} in steps of \SI{0.2}{pF} (\SI{0.1}{pF} minimum). 
\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{bandwidthlow}---Minimum Tunable Bandwidth in the Low Band}
The minimum required bandwidth in the low band  is measured as requirement~\sreqref{fbands}. The minimum required bandwidth is measured from the highest achievable bandwidth when sweeping each capacitor accordingly to requirement \sreqref{tunable}.

\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{bandwidthhigh}---Minimum Tunable Bandwidth in the High Band}
The minimum required bandwidth in the high band is measured as requirement~\sreqref{fbands}. The minimum required bandwidth is measured from the highest achievable bandwidth when sweeping each capacitor accordingly to requirement \sreqref{tunable}.

\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{bandwidthhigh}---Physical Dimensions}
The physical dimensions of the PCB, antenna and the external limitations are measured by a measuring tape. 

\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{copper}---Copper Thickness} This requirement is not tested, as the chosen PCB has a copper thickness of \SI{0.035}{mm}.

\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{correlation}---Correlation Between Antenna Elements}


\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{efficiency}---Total Efficiency in Free-Space}

\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{sar}---Maximum SAR}


\subsubsection{Test of Requirement~\sreqref{tunable}---Physical Dimensions} This requirement is not tested, as the variable capacitor chip is chosen as a wiSpry WS1040 MEMS chip accordingly to requirement~\freqref{wispry}.
