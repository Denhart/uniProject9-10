\section{CST Library}
In order to compare measurements and simulations, a library for processing CST simulations has been created. This makes it possible to import farfields, etc, from CST and convert them to the common data format described above. Once the data is in this format, the same functions can be used on measurements and simulations (e.g.\ computing envelope correlation coefficient).
