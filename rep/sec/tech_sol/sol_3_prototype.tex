\section{Inherently Non-resonant Antenna}
In this section the prototype of the Inherently non-resonant antenna will be described.

The prototype and the used tuning circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ant3techschem_proto}. Both antennas are made on a CNC mill in the AAU metal workshop. This was done in order to have perfectly smooth edges and cut the two-feed design accurately.

\subsection{Measurement and Simulation Comparison}
The simulated and measured S-parameter and total efficiency is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nonresonant_proto_matching}. The results are done with the tunable capacitor at \SI{0.3}{pF}. Furthermore some adjustments were done to the component values, the current values can be seen in Table \ref{fig:ant3schematic_proto}. 

From the S-parameter and the bandwidth table it is seen that both antennas covers the required bandwidth in the lower band. In the high band only the top antenna lacks \SI{80}{MHz}, but this should not be a major problem as the antenna covers the remaining bandwidth at approx. \SI{-3}{dB}. Comparing the simulated and the measured S-parameters, the results looks similar only with some detuning in the high band for both the side and top antenna.
The efficiency for the top antenna covers is approx. \SI{80}{\percent}, but drops to \SI{21}{\percent} from \SI{2200}{MHz} to \SI{2650}{MHz}. The side antenna covers the entire high band with approx. \SI{70}{\percent} to \SI{90}{\percent} efficiency. The low band efficiency is quite low at approx. \SI{35}{\percent} at \SI{960}{MHz} to approx. \SI{17}{\percent} at \SI{700}{MHz}.

The measured and simulated envelope correlation coefficient can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:nonresonant_proto_ecc}. In the high band the simulated and measured correlation is quite similar. However for the low band the simulated and measured results deviates. Comparing the correlation to the isolation loss \ref{fig:nonresonant_proto_sparam_eff} it is clear that correlation should be highest in the low band. The diviation in the low band results could be caused by the measurement placement of the antenna. The antenna should be placed in the same position for every measurement, which can be hard to accomplice, also as mentioned in the triangle feed prototype section \ref{sec:triang_proto}.

\section{Capacitor sweep}
The S-parameter sweep can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:nonresonant_proto_sweep_sparams}. The top antenna sweep S11 shows that the antenna is capable of covering the entire low band and most of the high band. In the high band the antenna have some problems from approx. \SI{2400}{MHz} to \SI{2650}{MHz}, as the return loss drops to approx. \SI{-3}{dB}. The results of the side antenna S22 shows that the antenna was unable to be tuned. Many component changes were made and it had no effect on the frequency tuning of the antenna. 
The highest isolation loss measured is \SI{-9}{dB} in the low band. In the high band the isolation loss is generally low with a max value of \SI{-14}{dB} over a bandwidth of approx. \SI{20}{MHz}. 

The efficiency sweep can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:nonresonant_proto_sweep_efficiency}
