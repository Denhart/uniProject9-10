\section{Triangle-Feed Antenna}

In Chapter~\ref{cha:prototypes} it was found that the triangle-feed antenna design was found to have the highest efficiency and to be the most sweepable of the designs. For this reason, the triangle-feed design has been chosen as the first design to move to the printed circuit board with the WiSpry tuners installed.

    \caption{Triangle-feed antenna on a PCB with two WiSpry tuners. The location of the side-feed is different from the prototype and for this reason, the side antenna has slightly different dimension. The changes from Figure~\ref{fig:ant2technical} is noted on the figure.}
    \label{fig:triang_pcb_enh}
\end{figure}

The antennas are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:triang_pcb_enh}. The side antenna has been moved further towards the top to align with the feed. Extra length has been added by the end of the triangle, as this results in a greater bandwidth around \SI{1800}{MHz}.

The antenna is tuned using the fiber-optic RFFE adapter described in Appendix~\ref{cha:optical_rffe_comm}.

    \label{fig:triang_pcb_sparams}
\end{figure}

The S-parameters sweeps are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:triang_pcb_sparams}. As it is seen, the high end of the high band -- near \SI{2.6}{GHz} -- does not resonate as well as the prototype. However, the low band can be covered quite well for both the top and the side antenna.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Total efficiency of the triangle-feed antennas with tuners.}
    \label{fig:triang_pcb_eff}
\end{figure}

The total efficiency is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:triang_pcb_eff}. The efficiency, likewise, reflects that resonance is lacking near \SI{2.6}{GHz}, so the mismatch loss is quite severe -- especially for the side antenna. The low band looks acceptable for both antennas as the top antenna has a total efficiency above \SI{-3.1}{dB} and the side antenna has a total efficiency above \SI{-5.5}{dB}.
