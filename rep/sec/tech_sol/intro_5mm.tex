\chapter{Minimized Design}
\label{cha_intro_5mm}
In this chapter, a second minimized design of the monopole antenna will be made.
The antenna choice was based on the simple design and matching of the monopole antenna.
A ground clearance simulation is carried out to investigate the effect on the bandwidth and the efficiency.

In the previous simulations and measurements, a tunable capacitor in the range \SI{0.3}{pF} to \SI{2.9}{pF} has been used. However, it has since been discovered that the WiSpry PCB, which will be described in Chapter~\ref{cha:pcb}, has two MEMS capacitors connected in parallel for the top antenna and four in parallel for the side antenna. This has here been exploited so that the minimized monopole is capable of tuning from \SI{0.6}{pF} to \SI{6}{pF} for the top antenna and from \SI{1.2}{pF} to \SI{12}{pF} for the side antenna. The higher tuning range makes it possible to make the antennas smaller and more resilient to user detuning.

The board used for the measurements in this chapter will be described in greater detail in Chapter~\ref{cha:pcb}.
