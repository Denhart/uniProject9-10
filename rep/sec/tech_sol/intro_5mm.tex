\chapter{Minimized Design}
\label{cha_intro_5mm}
In this chapter a second minimized design of the monopole antenna will be made.
The antenna choise was based on the simple design and matching of the monopole antenna.
A ground clearence simulation has been carried out to investigate the effect on the bandwidth and the efficiency.

In the privious simulations and measurements a tunable capacitor in the range \SI{0.3}{pF} to \SI{3}{pF} has been used. However it was later discovered that the WS1040 digital capacitor had the possibility of using two capacitors in parallel for the top antenna and four in parrallel for the side antenna. This possibility was of cource exploited so that the minimized monopole is capable of tuning from \SI{0.6}{pF} to \SI{6}{pF} for the top antenna and from \SI{1.2}{pF} to \SI{1.2}{pF}. The higher tuning range makes it possible to make the antenna both smaller and more resilient to user detuning.
