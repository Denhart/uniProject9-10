\section{Conclusion}
The three simulated designs show very promising results. All three appear to be able to cover the entire low and high band at a reasonably high efficiency. The three designs are very different. The monopole is a copper-in-air design with a simple matching network, the triangle-feed antenna is partially made on FR-4, and the inherently non-resonant design is very simple in its structure while having a more complex matching network.

Because the three designs are so different, they may respond very differently to user effects. The next chapter will cover the simulation of the three designs in three use cases as well as simulate the specific absorption rate of the designs.
