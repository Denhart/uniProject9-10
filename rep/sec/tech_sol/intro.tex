\chapter{Technical Solution}
\section{Introduction}
In this chapter the technical solution will be documented. The technical soulution includes three antenna designs simulated and measured in freespace and with user effects. All the antenna designs are done accordingly to the requirement specification~\ref{cha:reqspec}. Also as mentioned in the requirement specification, the antenna designs are made on a groundplane of the size $120\times55$\,\si{mm\squared}. The groundplane consists of a FR-4 layer with a thickness of \SI{1.5}{mm} and a cobber layer of \SI{0.035}{mm}.
