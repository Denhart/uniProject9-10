\section{Triangle-Feed Antenna}

A prototype of the triangle-feed antenna has been built. The results will be described in this section.

The prototype is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:triang_proto}. Compared to the simulation, see Figure~\ref{fig:ant2techschem}, a \SI{5}{mm} strip of copper has been added next to the feed line.
