\section{High Band Improvement}
From the S-parameter measurements of both the triangle feed antenna and the minimized monopole antenna it is clear that both antennas are experiencing problems in the high band.
The problem occured when going from the Wispy board without the chip to the final board with the communication PCB, battery and the Wispy chip. It seemed that, despite different antenna structures, the antennas were detuned when measured on the final Wispy board.
The first approach was to counteract the high band problem by creating another resonance at an even higher frequency than required. The minimized monopole was modified to be a four arm monopole with an extra resonance at approx. \SI{2.7}{GHz} for both the top and side antenna. The technical drawing of the modified monopole can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:sparam_5mm_highband} together with a Table \ref{fig:sparam_5mm_highband}of the component values used in the simulation.
Furthermore to find the course of the problem an investigation was made to wheater the detuning was caused by the communication PCB, battery or the Wispy chip.
