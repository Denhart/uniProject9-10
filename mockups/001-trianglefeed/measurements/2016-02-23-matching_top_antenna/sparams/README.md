Read these steps in a row. Initial values:
C1 = 3.6 pF
L1 = 7.5 nH
C2 = 2.2 nF
L2 = 5.6 nH
Antenna design is as simulated.

- 001: L1 = 5.6 nH
- 002: L1 = inf nH
- 003: L1 = 7.5 nH
- 004: L1 = 4.7 nH
- 005: L1 = 6.8 nH
- 006: C1 = 4 pF
- 007: C1 = 3 pF
- 008: Add 5 mm copper as shown in 008b
- 009: Csh1 = 0.5 pF
- 010: Csh1 = 0 pF
- 011: Csh1 = 1.1 pF
- 012: Csh1 = 0.7 pF
- 013: Csh1 = 0.9 pF
