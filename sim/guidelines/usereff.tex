\subsubsection{Hand Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 hand - Data mode
\begin{itemize}
\item Align antenna design with upper spacer.
\item Move the antenna design down until touching the lower spacer
\item If the antenna is longer than the lenght from the lower to the upper spacer, the antenna design exceeds the upper spacer.
\end{itemize}
\item 2 hand - read mode
\begin{itemize}
\item No standards for this mode - The Antenna design is placed as wanted.  
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Head Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item SAR measurement
\item Antenna design is aligned with the Antenna design in the ``1-simpler3 sar.cst'' phantom CST file. In the CST file, the antenna design is aligned, so that it barely touches the cheek, whereas in the ``SAR without hand.cst'' file only can be used for the bodyloss of head and hand.
\end{itemize}
