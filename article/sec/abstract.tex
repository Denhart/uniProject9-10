This paper proposes a digitally reconfigurable frequency MIMO LTE antenna system for counteracting the de-tuning created by the user. The requirements for such a mobile antenna system are very strict. The size is very limited while the required bandwidth and efficiency is high. The solution proposed in this paper is an antenna design with \SI{2.5}{mm} ground clearance, covering most of the LTE spectrum. 
The paper covers free-space simulations as well as user-effects simulations and prototyping. The MIMO antenna is designed for a tuner PCB with a digitally controllable MEMS tuner and shows promising results compared to state-of-art antenna designs. The top antenna has an efficiency above \SI{-4}{dB} from \SI{700}{MHz} to \SI{2450}{MHz} while the side antenna needs some improving. 
MIMO can be supported in the high frequency bands where correlation is very low. In the low band, the correlation peaks with a maximum value of \num{0.8} for the simulated talk-mode.
